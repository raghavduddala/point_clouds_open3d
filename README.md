# Welcome to the Point Clouds Fast Course

In this course, you will learn to build a 3D Object detection system.
The course can be found here: https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/point-clouds


## DATASET
The dataset used is the KITTI dataset.
I use a subset of 20 point cloud files for this course.
[Link to the full dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_object_velodyne.zip).

The course is currently being completed by using the dockerfile from this repository here: [My Open3D Dockerfile](https://github.com/raghavduddala/3d-obstacle-detection)
